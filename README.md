# ListView
ListView is a scrollable widget that can hold multiple widgets. For example, the developer can add `ListTile`, `Text`, or `Icon` widgets.  

```dart
ListView(
      children: <Widget>[
        TaskTile(),
    ])
```

## ListTile
The ListTile is a convenient widget to organize the children of a ListView. It contains properties such as `title` and `trailing`.

```dart
ListTile(
      title: Text('This is a task'),
      trailing: Checkbox(
        value: false,
      ),
    );
```

# ListTile State
In order to create a Stateful widget that updates when the UI interface is changed, a Global State should be created. A Global State is different from a Local State because the value is used across an app. In my ListTile widget, both the state of the checkbox and string are updated with the use of a variable called `isChecked`.

```dart
TaskCheckbox(
  checkboxState: isChecked,
  toggleCheckboxState: (bool checkboxState) {
    setState(() {
      isChecked = checkboxState;
    });
  }),

``` 
`isChecked` variable is passed into TaskCheckbox as a new property, so it can be used to update the checkbox. 

## Lifting State

![lift state](doc/widget-tree.PNG)

* Lift the State of tasks list to TasksScreen

  * Cut & Paste tasks list into TasksScreen
  * Convert TasksScreen into Stateful Widget
  * Pass tasks list into TaskList from TasksScreen

    `child: TasksList(tasks)`
  * Create TaskList constructor that accepts task list as a property

    ```dart 
    final List<Task> tasks;
    TasksList(this.tasks);
    ```

* Edit AddTaskScreen
  
  * save newTaskTitle in onChanged of TextField
  * Create a AddTaskScreen callback inside of TasksScreen that prints newTaskTitle
  * Create AddTaskScreen constructor that accepts a callback as a property

## Provider Widget

The Provider carries the state across multiple widgets. It is created from the [Inherited widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/InheritedWidget-class.html) and acts as a wrapper around it.

### Simple Scenario - No ChangeNotifier
* import the provider package from dart
* Create Provider widget around the top level widget.
In the example below, the Provider supplies the data variable to be used across the different widgets. 
* Angela's lesson shows Provider v3.0, but it has been updated to v4.0. In the newest version, builder method is replaced with the create and update methods. 

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
return Provider<String>(
  create: (context) => data,
  child: MaterialApp()
)}
```

* To access the data variable, use the following code. In the example, the Provider is returning the data so that it can be accessed within the Text widget. 

```dart
return Text(Provider.of<String>(context));
```

### Complex Scenario - ChangeNotifier

 This is more complex since it uses a method called ChangeNotifier that is prebuilt into Flutter. Angela used it to capture the updates from MyTextField into MyText. 

 The first step is to create a separate Data class that extends the ChangeNotifier class to update our data String. 

 ```dart
class Data extends ChangeNotifier{
  String data = 'Some data'
}
 ```

Next, we have to change the Provider class into a ChangeNotifierProvider that supplies a Data object. 

```dart
return ChangeNotifierProvider<Data>(
  builder: (context) => Data(),
)
```

We also have to alter the way the data is accessed from the Provider. Since the data is now in a separate Data class, you need to access the info from the .data property. 

```dart
return Text(Provider.of<Data>(context).data);
```

Create a changeString method within the Data class to update the string. The key part is the notifyListeners method which sends out a notification to rebuild the widgets that are listening to it. 

Finally, create a onChanged method inside MyTextField that accesses the changeString method from Provider class. The changeString method updates widgets with the notifyListeners method. The [listen: false](https://pub.dev/documentation/provider/latest/provider/Provider/of.html) is neccessary to implement the example below.

```dart
TextField(
  onChanged: (newText){
    Provider.of<Data>(context, listen: false).changeString(newText);
  }
)
```
